**CS 262 - Lab 01**

This lab is based on [*hyperlink to lab source*](cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/01introduction/lab.html)

*Hacks that I had to make*

Answers to the lab questions:
* App.js: Creates and stylizes the user interface, essentially creates what the user sees.

* package.json: References the where certain elements of the app are within the directory, so the main is index.js, as the andriod script is within react-native run-andriod.

* node_modules: Contains directories that contain modules for use in the app, such as color, emoji, exit code, and other useful modules.

* .gitignore: Used with git to properly save and document the code, most importantly what is to be ignored within the directory.
